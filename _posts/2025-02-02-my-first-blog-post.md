Welcome to my first blog post! In this post, I'll share some thoughts and include an image of niagara falls.

## Introduction
This is an example of a blog post written in Markdown. Markdown is a simple and easy-to-use syntax for writing content. You can add headings, lists, links, and even images.

## Adding an Image
Here's an image of a Niagara Waterfalls:

![Niagara Waterfalls](/assets/images/niagara.jpg)

You can also use HTML for more control over the image:

<img src="/assets/images/niagara.jpg" alt="Niagara Waterfalls" width="500" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;">

## Conclusion
That's it for this post! I hope you enjoyed it. Stay tuned for more updates.
